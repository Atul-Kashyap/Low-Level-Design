# Low-Level-Design

We try to solve the problem by rushing through the design process so that enough time is left at the end of the project to uncover the errors that were made because we rushed through the design process.

Low-level design (LLD) is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms.
Low-level design fills in some of the gaps to provide extra detail that’s necessary before developers can start writing code. It gives more specific guidance for how the parts of the system will work and how they will work together. It refines the definitions of the database, the major classes, and the internal and external interfaces.
High-level design focuses on what. Low-level design begins to focus on how.
